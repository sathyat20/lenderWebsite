You may need to add `--legacy-peer-deps` to some of these commands if you get deprecation errors

`npm install`

`npm i --save react-bootstrap`

`npm i -S @stripe/stripe-js`

`npm i -S @stripe/react-stripe-js`

# Lender Summary

## Debrief of the term
- All of our group members agree that we have gleaned a lot of useful information this term, especially in terms of working with JavaScript, CSS and HTML. The labs in particular, equipped us with skills that were easily transferable to the final project and both reinforced and clarified the skills/information we picked up from working on them. Eventually for the final project, our team really capitalised on each other's strengths and delegated tasks based on our team members' preferences and skill sets which was really helpful in creating both a functional and aesthetically appealing platform.
 
## What worked for the final project:
- Our team was effective in delegating tasks for different people which was really helpful in implementing the different functionalities for our platform and bringing them together eventually. 
- We also made sure to know what each other in our team was working on which was helpful when it came to last minute debugging when we merged our different parts together. 

## What didn't work for the final project:
- Our team faced quite a bit of challenge working with Git and dealing with the merge conflicts which resulted. While this was a problem initially, we grew comfortable working with Git overtime and this became less of an issue
- Given the scope to implement a wide range of functionalities for our project, we had a hard time deciding on what and what not to implement which took up some time.
